âœ… BATCH 201-300 SUCCESSFULLY CREATED

Summary:

- Reindexed all games: 363 total game pages now registered
- Total challenge directories: 285

Next Steps to Create More Batches:
=====================================

To create batches 301-400:
  START=301 END=400 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs && node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

To create batches 401-500:
  START=401 END=500 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs && node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

To create batches 501-600:
  START=501 END=600 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs && node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

To create batches 601-700:
  START=601 END=700 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs && node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

To create batches 701-800:
  START=701 END=800 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs && node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

To create batches 801-900:
  START=801 END=900 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs && node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

To create batches 901-1000:
  START=901 END=1000 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs && node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

How It Works:
=============

1. Each challenge rotates through 6 engine types:
   - reflex, anagram, stacker, pathfind, tileslide, memory

2. Each challenge rotates through 30 theme names:
   - vector, cipher, quantum, nebula, signal, matrix, rocket, jungle, aurora, kernel,
     plasma, cobalt, orbit, cosmic, delta, omega, riddle, forge, atlas, nova, lyra,
     phoenix, onyx, titan, zephyr, terra, lumen, axiom, prime, echo

3. All challenges integrate with:
   - AdSlot components for monetization
   - UpsellSidebar for premium features
   - PaywallGate for premium access control
   - Leaderboard for competitive play

4. The reindex script automatically:
   - Scans all app directories
   - Finds pages with page.jsx/page.tsx files
   - Generates content/games/generated.json with slug and title mappings
   - Excludes api, pay, games-addons, and dashboard directories

Custom Batch Creation:
=====================

You can customize the batch generation:

# Change prefix:
  PREFIX=minigame START=1 END=50 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs

# Create custom range:
  START=1500 END=1599 node scripts/add-factory-batch.mjs

# Always reindex after creating new games:
  node scripts/reindex-games.mjs

File Structure:
==============

Each generated challenge page follows this structure:

app/
  challenge-[theme]-[number]/
    page.jsx

Example: app/challenge-lyra-201/page.jsx

Content is a single-page React component with:
- Header with game title
- Ad slots (top, mid, side)
- Game engine component
- Paywall gate
- Leaderboard
- Upsell sidebar
